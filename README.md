# tutr  
##what is tut.r? you.r ultimate study buddy!
tut.r is a tinder-inspired web app that will match students wanting to find a study buddy || study group || tutor || tutee!
##how it'll works:
* users indicate their availability just by opening the app and selecting how they want to study (one to one || group).
* users will then scroll through available potential study mates in their area and choose based on mutual study topics and interests.
* matched users will then be able to communicate with each other to indicate where they want to meet to study!
* if no local study mates are available, users can match with other users to setup remote, virtual study sessions!
